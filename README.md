## I Liked

I liked how I was able to make  an actual game that I could interact with and let my friend play on.

## Challenging moment

It was challenging at first to animate the same object using script function and the animation transition when the animation tries to stay at its initial location set. 
The lighting was also difficult to adjust when varieties of shaders were used. Using the HLSL learned in course 2 also made that object very dark compared to other shaders.
Changing the very last line of HLSL from FallBack "Diffuse" to FallBack "Unlit" solved the problem.
